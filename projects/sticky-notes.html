                            Sticky notes is a practice project I wrote from
                            scratch after I learned the basics of the Qt
                            framework. I decided to do this project because I
                            quite like the sticky notes application that comes
                            with Windows 11, but I couldn't find a similar
                            application for my old laptop running Linux with
                            Xfce-4 desktop. Therefore, I wrote my own sticky
                            notes application! Most parts of the project are
                            finished, but there are a few extensions that I will
                            discuss below.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="header--overview">overview</h3>
                        <p>This application consists of two parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A central panel where you can view and manage
                                all the active notes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Individual notes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            The design is very much like the sticky notes
                            application on Windows 11. The user first start the
                            central panel, then from the central panel the user
                            can create new sticky notes. Each sticky note
                            supports the following key functionalities:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Font manipulation: text can be made italic,
                                bold, and underlined.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Color palette: the background color can be
                                changed to one of eight preconfigured colors at
                                any time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always on top: even without focus, the sticky
                                note can appear above other windows. This
                                functionality can be toggled.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            The UML diagram below shows the structural design of
                            the application. Note that fields and methods
                            related to UI elements (buttons, frames, etc.) are
                            not shown.

                        <p>
                            Please note the design choices I took to make the
                            project better structured. The central panel is only
                            responsible for the UI (i.e. the view) of the
                            application, all the functionality implementations
                            (i.e. the controls) are separated into a class
                            called Note List. This class manages all the active
                            notes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A list item is an item that appears on the central
                            panel. Each list item is uniquely associated to a
                            note widget. A note widget and its associated list
                            item are coupled through the signal-and-slot
                            mechanism of Qt (an event system, similar to that of
                            JavaScript in terms of concepts). The diagram below
                            shows part of the coupling.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every time the user modifies the content of a note
                            widget, a signal is sent to the associated list
                            item, and its slot responds by updating its content
                            accordingly. When the user deletes a note widget, a
                            signal is sent to the associated list item, which
                            responds by deleting itself. Similarly, when the
                            user deletes a list item, the associated note widget
                            responds by deleting itself. Note this is
                            simplified, in my application there is also user
                            confirmation involved.

                        <p>
                            The color picker instance is only constructed when
                            the user clicks on the color palette button on the
                            note widget. When the color picker shows up, the UI
                            on the note widget is automatically hidden. When the
                            user has picked a new color, the color picker is
                            automatically hidden (and destructed) and the UI on
                            the note widget returns. This creates a clean and
                            intuitive user experience.

                            Finally, the Fixed Height Delegate class is an
                            auxiliary class that gives a fixed height to each
                            list item.

                        <p>
                            Below are some key features I have implemented for
                            this application:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                New note widgets can be created from both the
                                central panel and other note widgets. This makes
                                it a lot simpler to create a new note widget
                                when the central panel is minimized.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Manage all the active note widgets in the
                                central panel.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a note widget does not have focus, its UI is
                                automatically hidden. This creates a much
                                cleaner look especially when many note widgets
                                are open.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The text font in a note widget can be modified
                                (italic, bold, and underline).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The background color of a note widget can be
                                changed to one of eight preconfigured colors at
                                any time. (Windows 11 sticky notes application
                                did not implement this!)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pin a note widget on top of other windows. This
                                makes reference easy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Below is a short gif demonstrating these features.

                                Sqlite integration. Before the application is
                                closed, automatically save all the active notes
                                to a Sqlite database.
                            </li>
                            <li>Search for note content.</li>
                            <li>
                                Basic settings (e.g. skip dialog before
                                deleting, open all notes from last time at
                                startup, etc.) that can be changed in the
                                central panel.
