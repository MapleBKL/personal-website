                        <p>
                            Though I have never taken the computer science
                            trilogy at UC Berkeley (CS 61A, 61B, and 61C), I did
                            self-study them when I started to learn computer
                            science by myself. Thanks to my alumni identity, I
                            could easily access all the course materials,
                            including auto-graders. Therefore, this trilogy got
                            me serious about computer science very quickly.
                            Berkeley Map was the final project for CS 61B
                            &mdash; algorithms &amp; data structures.

                        <p>
                            Through this project, I took a peek at how frontend
                            and backend interact with each other in a web
                            application, and how Java plays a crucial role in
                            the backend. As a bonus, this project also lent me
                            some insight into how raster map applications are
                            implemented.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="section overview" id="overview">
                        <h3 class="header--overview">overview</h3>
                        <p>This project consists of three parts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Map rastering: according to the user's viewing
                                location, zoom level, and viewport size, compute
                                the 2D array of map blocks that cover the user's
                                request.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Graph building: all the map data (locations and
                                roads) are stored in an XML file. The task is to
                                parse the XML file and convert the entire map
                                data into a graph.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Route searching: according to the start and end
                                locations the user selects on the map, compute
                                the shortest path that leads from the start
                                location to the end location.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            There are two additional tasks for part 3 (route
                            searching): generating plain English navigation
                            instructions, and displaying autocomplete
                            suggestions when the user is searching for a
                            location.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="section technical" id="technical">
                        <h3 class="header--technical">details</h3>
                        <h4>Map Rastering</h4>
                        <p>
                            This task is relatively easy (apaproximately
                            equivalent to a LeetCode medium-level problem).
                            After some careful mathematical manipulations, one
                            could easily deduce the algorithm. The data
                            (latitude, longitude, zoom level, viewport size,
                            etc.) is stored in the browser as a JavaScript
                            object, the task is to parse this object and
                            retrieve all the necessary information, and then
                            compute the 2D array of map blocks that the frontend
                            needs to display the required region at the required
                            zoom level.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Graph Building</h4>
                        <p>
                            This task feels more like a real world (i.e.
                            industry) task. I was given a massive XML file
                            filled with complicated map data (locations for
                            nodes and roads for edges), and I was given a tool
                            that I had never used before (an XML parser called
                            the SAX parser), and the task was to figure out how
                            to use the provided parser to parse the provided XML
                            file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This task took me quite some time, and after a lot
                            of Googling and trying around, I eventually figured
                            out how to use the parser. The remaining task of
                            this part is easier: construct a graph (represented
                            as an adjacency list) out of the parsed map data.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Route Searching</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is the most fun part of the project. The user
                            can click two arbitrary locations on the map, and
                            the task is to compute the shortest path leading
                            from one location to the other. The selected
                            locations are received by the routing endpoint, and
                            the first task is to parse the JavaScript object.
                            The second step is to find the closest locations on
                            the map to the user-selected locations (since we are
                            searching in the graph, clearly we first need to
                            convert the arbitrarily chosen locations onto the
                            graph). The next step is then to perform an A*
                            search. The shortest path is sent back to the
                            frontend and displayed on the map.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Additional Tasks</h4>
                        <p>
                            However, this is not the end of it. For fun and for
                            more practice, I implemented two additional features
                            that improved user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plain English navigation instructions: once the
                            shortest path is computed, the backend then
                            generates a series of navigation instructions (e.g.
                            continue straight on Maple Street for 1.5miles, turn
                            left onto Euclid Avenue, etc.), which are then sent
                            back to the frontend and displayed.

                            typing in the search bar, a list of locations in the
                            map database that start with the user's current
                            input is displayed under the search bar.

                                Integrate some of the work to the frontend. In
                                this project, the backend is responsible for
                                drawing the routes on the map. However, a better
                                approach (that reduces the workload of the
                                backend) would be to pass the route information
                                to the frontend, and let the user's browser draw
                                the route.
